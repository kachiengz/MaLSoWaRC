MaLSoWaRC is a set of four codes that simulates Soil Water Retention Curve (MaLSoWaRC) for loamy sand soil subjected to monotonic wetting and monotonic drying

In order to use any of the four codes, ensure that the following Python Language libraies are installed on your computer:
(1) Tensorflow
(2) Numpy
(3) sklearn
(4) matplotlib

Set the working directory to the directory where your measured SWRC data is stored. This involves modifying this line in the code:
"pd.read_csv('E:/Fall2018/SupportVectorRegression/SoilMositureData/Data/Submit/Code/Drying1.csv')"

On the command line - which is Anaconda Prompt (for Windows OS) or command prompt (for Linux/Mac):
(1) type "python "name of the code.py" 
(2) and then hit enter on the keyboard to run the program
